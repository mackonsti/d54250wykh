High Sierra "Vanilla" Installation
==================================

Generate a random number with Clover Configurator and check it on Apple's Coverage Check website:
https://checkcoverage.apple.com/us/en/?sn=GENERATEDSERIAL

The following AML files are *no* longer needed as most device IDs are detected directly by High Sierra and newer:

SSDT-GLAN.aml = IntelMausiEthernet support for Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller I218-V [8086:1559]
SSDT-HDEF.aml = AppleALC support with injected layout ID (alternatively in Clover set boot arguments as "alcid=1")
SSDT-IGPU.aml = WhateverGreen support for Intel Corporation Haswell HD Audio Controller [8086:0a0c]
SSDT-IGPU.aml = WhateverGreen support for Intel Corporation Haswell Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0a26]
SSDT-IMEI.aml = Vanilla support for Intel Corporation 8 Series HECI Interface [8086:9c3a]
SSDT-LPCB.aml = Vanilla support for Intel Corporation 8 Series LPC Controller [8086:9c43]
SSDT-SATA.aml = Vanilla support for Intel Corporation 8 Series SATA Controller [AHCI mode] [8086:9c03]
SSDT-SBUS.aml = Needed file to add virtual BUS0 and DVL0 devices (vanilla)
SSDT-USB.aml  = Needed file to inject device properties only
SSDT-WIFI.aml = Vanilla support only with injected Atheros ID

N.B. The file SSDT-Methods.aml contains fixes for renamed HDEF, EH01, XHC, ARPT.


These are the latest files used for High Sierra and above:

SSDT-All-Devices.aml = Manage devices (MCHC) (IMEI) (SBUS) adding device names and models to IORegistry.
SSDT-All-Methods.aml = Provide fake device ID for (ARPT) and (HDEF) as well as more (EHC1) and (XHC1) port properties.
SSDT-All-OS-Hack.aml = Improved USB behaviour by adding further Windows versions for ACPI implementation.


Minimal Clover UEFI Drivers (x64)
=================================

ApfsDriverLoader.efi = Recognize and boot from APFS volumes by loading apfs.efi from ApfsContainer located on block device.
AptioMemoryFix.efi   = Latest driver to fix memory problems on EFI firmware, do not use with OsxAptioFix3Drv.efi.
DataHubDxe.efi       = DataHub protocol and mandatory for macOS.
FSInject.efi         = Driver responsible for Clover kext injection into kernelcache.
SMCHelper.efi        = Restore SMC keys left in NVRAM by FakeSMC (not compatible with VirtualSMC.efi)
VBoxHfs.efi          = Alternative open source EFI file-system driver for HFS+ partitions.

Abandoned/Replaced:
OsxAptioFix3Drv.efi  = Alternate driver (v3) to fix memory problems on EFI firmware, do not use with OsxAptioFix2Drv.efi.

Optional:
EmuVariableUefi.efi  = Support for NVRAM variables needed by macOS if hardware NVRAM is not supported.


Clover Settings
===============

If we are using a CPU-generated SSDT.aml we need to drop the corresponding CPU table(s).

Setting "DropOEM = True" causes the B0D3 (HDAU) device to disappear.

Better drop specific tables like Cpu0Ist, ApIst, Cpu0Cst, ApCst instead.

Alternatively, drop DMAR and MATS signatures but setting "FixHeaders = True" is needed.

N.B. The MLB variable in "Rt Variables" of Clover must be the same as "Board Serial Number" in SMBIOS.

N.B. According to https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen we need the boot argument "-igfxnohdmi" to disable DP to HDMI conversion patches for digital sound.


Basic MacOS Kernel Extensions
=============================

The following drivers are required for Mojave to work properly:

Patcher       = Lilu.kext
Audio         = AppleALC.kext
Graphics      = WhateverGreen.kext
Ethernet      = IntelMausi.kext / IntelMausiEthernet.kext
SMC           = VirtualSMC.kext
CPU Monitor   = SMCProcessor.kext
Super I/O     = SMCSuperIO.kext
Wireless      = AirportBrcmFixup.kext
Bluetooth     = BrcmPatchRAM2.kext (Mojave)
BT Firmware   = BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext (in /L/E/)

Previous kexts used:

SMC           = FakeSMC.kext (by Slice)
CPU Monitor   = IntelCPUMonitor.kext (by Slice)
H/W Monitor   = HWMonitorSMC2.app (by Slice)
USB Ports Fix = USBInjectAll.kext (obsolete due to USBPorts.kext)
