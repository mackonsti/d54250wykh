Required BIOS Settings
======================

DEVICES  --> "Video Configuration" section      --> Set "IGD Minimum Memory" to 128MB (default is 64MB)

(+) Legacy boot is required to set the basic start-up monitor resolution and avoid flickering problem on macOS desktop. This could also be related to needing this setting to reduce the "glitch effect" during black boot screen on OS X 10.10 and 10.11 systems, together with special Clover patch.
