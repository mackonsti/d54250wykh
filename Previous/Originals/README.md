# Original Clover Configurations

Stored are here the different Clover configurations that evolved over time and over OS generations installed, leading to the one used **actively** today. These are kept only for reference and comparison, as they are most likely outdated, especially with respect to some officially deprecated `<keys>` for example `SlpSmiAtWake` and `KernelCpu` etc.
